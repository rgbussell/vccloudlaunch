This is WIP.

Code for running vc pipeline in the cloud.

### What is this repository for? ###

* At this time, the repo is used to develop and the test the code.

### How do I get set up? ###

* Set up this code where it can be executed from the command line.
* The vc analysis code will run remotely, so you do not need to set that up on your system.

### Who do I talk to? ###
